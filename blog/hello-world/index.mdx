I was always fascianted about how can we get more productive as developers.
Shall we follow the TDD practices? What we gain if we do? What we lose if we don't?

Is there any better way to develop software and maintain high quality?

Lets see an example, a classic Counter app. 

```javascript live=true title=Counter
() => {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState({ counter: 0 })

  const actions = {
    decrease: () => setState({ ...state, counter: state.counter - 1 }),
    increase: () => setState({ ...state, counter: state.counter + 1 }),
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={actions.decrease}>-</button>
        Counter:
        <span>{state.counter}</span>
      <button onClick={actions.increase}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}

```
