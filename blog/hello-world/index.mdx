import {Counter} from "./Counter.js";

<Counter />

I was always fascinated about how can we get more productive as developers.
Shall we follow the TDD practices? What we gain if we do? What we lose if we don't?

Is there any better way to develop software and maintain high quality?

Lets see an example, a classic Counter app. 


```javascript live=true title=Counter
import * as React from "react";

type DState = { counter: number };

const actions = {
  "+1": (s: DState) => ({ ...s, counter: s.counter + 1 }),
  "-1": (s: DState) => ({ ...s, counter: s.counter - 1 }),
};

type ActionType = keyof typeof actions;

interface Props {
  startState: DState;
  pastEvents: string[];
  onEvent: (action: string) => void;
}

export const Counter: React.FC<Props> = (
  { startState, pastEvents, onEvent },
) => {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState({ startState, pastEvents });

  const calculatedState = state.pastEvents.reduce(
    (prevValue, currentValue) => actions[currentValue](prevValue),
    startState,
  );

  return <div>
    <button {...update("-1")}>-</button>
    {calculatedState.counter}
    <button {...update("+1")}>+</button>
  </div>;

  function update(action: ActionType) {
    return {
      "data-onclick": String(action),
      onClick: (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
        onEvent(action);
        setState({ ...state, pastEvents: [...state.pastEvents, action] });
      },
    };
  }
};
```

That was it!
