<Counter />

I was always fascinated about how can we get more productive as developers.
Shall we follow the TDD practices? What we gain if we do? What we lose if we don't?

Is there any better way to develop software and maintain high quality?

Lets see an example, a classic Counter app. 


```javascript live=true title=Counter
() => {
  const actions = {
    decrease: state => ({ counter: state.counter - 1 }),
    double: state => ({ counter: state.counter * 2 }),
    increase: state => ({ counter: state.counter + 1 }),
  }

  const [events, setEvents] = React.useState([])

  const state = events.reduce((state, ev) => actions[ev](state), { counter: 0 })

  const onClick = e => {
    const text = String(e.target.innerText)

    if (text.includes("-")) setEvents([...events, "decrease"])
    else if (text.includes("+")) setEvents([...events, "increase"])
    else if (text.includes("x2")) setEvents([...events, "double"])
  }
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={e => onClick(e)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={e => onClick(e)}>x2</button>
      Counter:
      <span>{state.counter}</span>
      <button onClick={e => onClick(e)}>+</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

That was it!
