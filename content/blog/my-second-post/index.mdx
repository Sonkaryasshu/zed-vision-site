import Layout from '../../../src/Layout.tsx'
import { Button } from "@material-ui/core"

<Layout>  


And lets have some typography

<hr />

# h1 
## h2 
### h3
#### h4 
##### h5 


*This text will be italic*




I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.


**This text will be bold**


- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item


```javascript
const counter = React.useCounter({ count: 1 })
```

As Kanye West said:

_You **can** combine them_


# h1 

## h2 ```code```

text


```var i=code```
 
</Layout>
